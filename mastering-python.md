# Mastering Python: A Quick Guide

> **Note:** This guide is kept short and simple containing only essentials, which reference the actual content. There are no explicitly goals defined, you must achieve, or time frames to meet. Feel free to develop your skills. The publishers and books mentioned in the text are personal recommendations that don't bring any provision.

Mastering the programming language Python consists, as in many other things, of the following four levels:

* [**The Beginning**](#the-beginning)</br>
Learn the basics, e.g. the syntax, keywords, data types, classes, functions, etc. and get familiar with the programming language. 
* [**Transition**](#transition)</br>
Dive into the depths of the standard libraries, other frameworks as well as the concepts of functional and object-oriented programming with Python.
* [**Practice and Improvement**](#practice-and-improvement)</br>
Improve and sharpen your skills. Learn what effectiveness and efficiency in the context of scripting and software development means.
* [**Mastery**](#mastery)</br>
Get an expert in certain fields by developing a deep understanding of a specific domain.

How long the process takes depends on your capacity and ability to learn. If you want to be really good, it lasts several years. It's best to find a mentor who is already where you'd like to be and can help you on your journey. But you can also go on your own. All that matters is to start and keep moving forward. 

## The Beginning 
 
> **Note:** Especially at the beginning, it can quickly become a mass of things to learn triggering a feeling of being overwhelmed. Take the time you need.

If you're new in Python, than first things first. Learn the basics and the core principles. A simple way to start is working through the [*Tutorial*](https://docs.python.org/3.8/tutorial/index.html) within the [*Python Documentation*](https://docs.python.org/3/). In general, the official Python documentation offers a lot of useful knowledge and is worth a look. Alternatively, there are a lots of stuff on [*YouTube*](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=python3+tutorial) or within online courses. If you prefer reading than have a look to Mark Lutz's [*Learning Python*](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-python-5th/9781449355722/). As IDE for coding with Python [*PyCharm*](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) (Community edition is free available) is a good choice.

For a good programming style you should also know the following [*Python Enhancement Proposals*](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/) (PEPs):
* [*PEP 8 - Style Guide for Python Code*](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
* [*PEP 20 - The Zen of Python*](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/)

## Transition

Besides [*built-in types*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html), [*built-in functions*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html) and [*built-in exceptions*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html) Python offers many modules within the [*standard libraries*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html) for use, e.g.  [*string*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html), [*enum*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html), [*collections*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html), [*argparse*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) ([*tutorial*](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/argparse.html)), [*sys*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html), [*os*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html), [*logging*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html) ([*howto*](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html#logging-howto)), [*subprocess*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html) ([*asyncio*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-subprocess.html)), [*json*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html) and many more.

Python supports various programming paradigms. On the one side [*functional programming*](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/functional.html) is supported with the [*modules*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functional.html) [*itertools*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html), [*functools*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html) and [*operator*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html) containing higher-order functions. On the other hand Python is an object-oriented programming language with its use of [*class*](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html), see also abstract base classes - [*abc*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html) module. The behavior of classes can be customized by [*descriptors*](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/descriptor.html).

A common principle to save resources like time and money: "Don't reinvent the wheel". For specific tasks, when the standard libraries don't be enough, there are numerous frameworks available, e.g. [*request*](https://3.python-requests.org/), [*django*](https://www.djangoproject.com/) or [*jinja*](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com). For installing third party modules use [*pip*](https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html).

## Practice and Improvement 

The last two levels, *The Beginning* and *Transition*, were about content, for example, syntax, features and modules. This section, *Practice and Improvement*, and the next level *Mastery* are about context, the big picture, and *"clean code"*. Two good clues to producing *"clean code"* and *"clean architecture"* are effectiveness and efficiency:

* Effectiveness - What are the correct items (e.g. build-ins, modules or frameworks) to build a good solution?
* Efficiency - What does a good solution looks like?

Implicitly, both terms covers numerous dimensions in software development, e.g. use cases, requirements, software architecture, complexity, performance and resource consumption. To find a good or even the best solution, you need, beside knowledge and skills the third keystone: Experience - The ability to know what not to do. 

Building a solid foundation requires practice by reading other's code, writing own code and refactor bad code. Improvement comes with the analysis of existing solutions and finding a better one. Always have the inner attitude to produce stable and *"clean code"*, including a appropriate documentation and testing.

## Mastery

To achieve *Mastery*, firstly, you must become an expert within certain fields of a specific domain by developing deep understanding. At this point, learning is a livelong process repeating the four levels. Repeating the previous items with a higher level yields new perspectives and ideas.

*Mastery* is also characterized by providing simple domain-specific solutions to complex tasks, which maybe show new ways or even will end in new trends. The knowledge and skills then mostly extend beyond pure Python and include, for example, working with large code basis, designing or analysis of software architectures or maintaining software.
