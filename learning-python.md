# Learning Python

1. Learn the basics, e.g. syntax, keywords, data types, etc.
2. Get familiar with standard libraries, functional and object oriented-programming
3. Improve your programming skills and learn other frameworks
4. Get an expert in your domain


## The Beginning

If you're new in the Python programming language, than first things first: Learn the basics and the core principles of the Python programming language.

* A good way to start is working through the [Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3.8/tutorial/index.html) within the [Python3 Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/).
* Alternatily, there is also a lots of stuff on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=python3+tutorial), online courses or if you prefer reading:

  *Learning Python,

  ISBN-13 : 978-1449355739*
* Recommanded IDE for coding with Python: [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)

For a good programming style you should already be familiar with [PEP 8 - Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and [PEP 20 - The Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/).
