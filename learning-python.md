# Learning Python

Due to the fact that there are a lot of materials on how to learn Python, the following guide briefly describes one possible way.  Essentially, the path to mastering Python, as in many other things, consists of the following four phases:

1. The Beginning - Learn the basics, e.g. syntax, keywords, data types, classes, functions, etc. and get familiar with the Python programming language. 
2. The Transition - Dive into the depths of the standard libraries, other frameworks as well as the concepts of functional and object-oriented programming.
3. Practice and Improvement - Improve and sharpen your skillsi.Learn what Effectiveness and efficiency really means.
4. Mastery - Get an expert by developing a deep understanding of your domain.

How long the process takes depends on your willingness to learn. If you want to be really good, it lasts several years. It's best to find a mentor who is already where you'd like to be and can be helpful on your journey. But you can also go on your own. All that matters is to start, don't give up and keep improving - the rest will come by itself.

## The Beginning

If you're new in the Python programming language, than first things first: Learn the basics and the core principles of the programming language.

* A good way to start is working through the   [Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3.8/tutorial/index.html) within the [Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/).
* Alternatily, there is also a lots of stuff on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=python3+tutorial), online courses or if you prefer reading:
  [Learning Python](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-python-5th/9781449355722/) from Mark Lutz,
* Recommanded IDE for coding with Python: [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)

For a good programming style you should be familiar with [PEP 8 - Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and [PEP 20 - The Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/) from the beginning.

## The Transition

Python brings within the [standard libraries](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html) many functions that can be used for the implementation, e.g.
* [built-in](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html), [exceptions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html), [string](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html), [enum](https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html), [collections](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html)
* sys, os, logging, subprocess, json, ...

Python provides various [modules](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functional.html) containing higher-order functions for [functional programming](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/functional.html) 
* [itertools](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html)
* [functools](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html)
* [operator](https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html)

Object-oriented Programming with Python:
* [Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python 3](https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/) by David Amos
* [abc](https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html) module

A common principle in software development: "Don't reinvent the wheel". For specific tasks, when the standard libraries do not suffice, there are numerous frameworks available, e.g.
* [request](https://3.python-requests.org/)
* [django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
* [jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com)
* Howto installing Python modules with [pip](https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html)
