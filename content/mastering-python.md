## Introduction

Mastering the programming language Python consists, as in many other things, of the following four levels:

* [*The Beginning*](#the-beginning)</br>
Get familiar with the programming language and learn the basics, for example, the syntax, keywords, data types and structures.
* [*Transition*](#transition)</br>
Work your way into the standard libraries, other frameworks as well as the concepts of functional and object-oriented programming.
* [*Practice and Improvement*](#practice-and-improvement)</br>
Improve and sharpen your skills: Learn what effectiveness and efficiency in the context of scripting and software development means.
* [*Mastery*](#mastery)</br>
Get an expert in certain fields by developing a deep understanding of a specific domain.

How long the process takes to become a *master* depends on your ability and capacity to learn. If you want to be really good, it lasts several years. Maybe you have someone who can support you. But the most important thing: Start and keep moving forward.

## The Beginning 

If you're new, than first things first. Learn the basics and core principles about Python. A simple way to start is working through the [*Tutorial*](https://docs.python.org/3.8/tutorial/index.html) within the [*Python Documentation*](https://docs.python.org/3/). The official documentation contains a lot of useful knowledge and is worth a look. Alternatively, there are a lots of stuff on [*YouTube*](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=python3+tutorial) or within online courses. If you prefer reading than have a look to Mark Lutz's *Learning Python* (see *Further Reading*). As an IDE [*PyCharm*](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) is a good choice - The community edition is free available.

For a good programming style you should also know the following [*Python Enhancement Proposals*](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/) (PEPs):
* [*PEP 8 - Style Guide for Python Code*](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
* [*PEP 20 - The Zen of Python*](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/)

## Transition

Besides [*built-in types*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html), [*built-in functions*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html) and [*built-in exceptions*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html) Python offers many modules within the [*standard libraries*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html) for use, e.g.  [*string*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html), [*enum*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html), [*collections*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html), [*argparse*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html), [*sys*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html), [*os*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html), [*logging*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html), [*subprocess*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html), [*json*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html) and many more. If the standard libraries are not enough, then there are numerous frameworks from third parties like [*requests*](https://3.python-requests.org/), [*django*](https://www.djangoproject.com/) or [*jinja*](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com) - *Don't reinvent the wheel* to avoid mistakes (that others have already made) and save resources. For installing third party modules use [*pip*](https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html).

> **Note**: It happens from time to time that (third party) libraries contain backdoors or vulnerabilities in general that can be exploited by attackers. Always be careful and inform if there are known ones, e.g. under [*CVE Details*](https://www.cvedetails.com/).

Python supports various programming paradigms. On the one side Python supports [*functional programming*](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/functional.html) with [*modules*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functional.html) like [*itertools*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html) (see also package [more-itertools](https://pypi.org/project/more-itertools/)), [*functools*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html) as well as [*operator*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html) containing higher-order functions and on the other one object-oriented programming with its use of [*classes*](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html) (see also [*abstract base classes*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html)).

## Practice and Improvement

The last two sections were about *content*. This and the next section focus the *context* - the big picture. Two definitive factors for context within scripting and software development are *effectiveness* and *efficiency:*

* Effectiveness - What are the correct items (e.g. build-ins, modules or frameworks) to build a good solution?
* Efficiency - What does a way looks like to implement and run a good solution?

Implicitly, both terms covers numerous dimensions in software development, e.g. use cases, requirements, software architecture, complexity, performance and resource consumption. In programming, one speaks of *"clean code"* and *"clean architecture"*. Especially for Python the term and meaning of *"pythonic"* should be known.

Building a solid foundation requires practice by reading other's code, writing own code and refactor bad code. Improvement comes with the analysis of existing solutions and finding a better one. Furthermore, to find a good or even the best solution requires beside knowledge and skills the third aspect: Experience - The ability to know what not to do. Always have the inner attitude to produce *"clean code"*, including useful documentation and testing.

## Mastery

To achieve *Mastery*, firstly, you need to become an expert within one or more fields of a specific domain by developing deep understanding. At this point, learning is a livelong process to handle new technologies and stay up to date. Repeating the items from beginner to master on a higher level can also yields new perspectives.

*Mastery* is also characterized by providing *simple* domain-specific solutions to complex tasks, which may result in new trends. The knowledge and skills then mostly extend beyond pure Python programming and includes, for example, working with large code basis, designing complex software architectures, leading programming teams or maintaining software systems.

Due to the long and fluent process of develop knowledge, skills and experience, one does not really notice at what point the master degree is reached. It's more likely to be *"awarded"* by someone else.

## Notes

- Learn only one thing at a time, not all at once. Especially at the beginning, it can quickly become a mass of things to learn so you feel overwhelmed and stupid. Take the time you need.
- Programming is a skill, and a skill is learned by practice and repetition. The road to *mastery* is long and full of challenges. Constant learning and overcoming obstacles is what makes you become good.
- A smart way to gain practical knowledge is to explore publicly available projects (e.g. on [*github*](https://github.com/)). Participate to open-source projects or create your own.
